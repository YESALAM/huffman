Adaptive / Dynamic Huffman coding implementation in Java

I've done this in autumn of 2002 as an assignment in "Data and File Structures" class. As I recall it worked but take that with a grain of salt and keep an eye on possible bugs if you intend to use it.

Afaik at that time latest Java was 1.4. Unfortunately I can't remember where I did find BitWriter/BitReader implementations used in test.java.
